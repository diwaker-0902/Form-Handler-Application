# Form-Handler-Application

Overview:     
This project features a form handling application built with the MERN stack and styled using Bootstrap. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can interact with a form on one side of the page and view the results of CRUD operations on the other side.

Key Features:
Interactive Form: On the left side of the page, users can fill out and submit a form. This form is designed for easy data entry.
CRUD Operations: The right side of the page displays a table showing the results of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. This allows users to manage and view their data dynamically.
Seamless Integration: The frontend and backend are well-integrated, ensuring that data entered into the form is accurately reflected in the table and stored in the MongoDB database.
Real-Time Data: Changes made through the form are immediately visible in the table, providing real-time feedback to users.
Bootstrap Styling: The application uses Bootstrap to create a clean and user-friendly interface.

Technologies Used:
MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for building a full-stack application.
Bootstrap: For styling and responsive design.
MongoDB: To store and manage data.
